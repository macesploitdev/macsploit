## Tips for Safer Use

**Account Security:**

- Don't link payment methods to scripting accounts
- Use different emails and usernames from your main identity

- **Enable FileVault** disk encryption for additional security
- **Regular Time Machine backups** before major **macsploit download** updates
- **Check Activity Monitor** occasionally to verify **mac executor** resource usage is normal

**Script Safety:**

- **Use built-in script hub first** - 3,000+ scripts including **macsploit grow a garden** are pre-vetted
- **Avoid random pastebin scripts** - many contain malicious code or keyloggers
- **Check script ratings** in hub (community voting system)
- **Test scripts in private servers** before public use

- **Don't advertise** your use of **macsploit roblox** in game chat or profiles
- **Use private servers** for testing aggressive scripts
